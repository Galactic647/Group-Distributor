# Simple Group Distributions
A simple script for my class leader, she is pretty busy with stuff and often take a while
to make groups when the teachers asked, I offer a help and here it is.

## Usage
For indonesia ver.
```
usage: python pembagian.py
```
For english ver.
```
usage: python distribute.py
```

At first time running it, it will generate a txt file that you need to fill with names.

You can add "//" at the start of a line and everything in that line will be ignored,
note that it's not the same as comment.

If successful you will see an output in form of txt file with the distributed groups.

This script can also be compiled into an exe file with pyinstaller.
```
usage: pyinstaller distribute.py --console
```
